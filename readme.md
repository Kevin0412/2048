# AI2048
尝试使用dqn训练智能体玩2048

run game_2048.py and you can play 2048 in the terminal. and your game data will be saved in human_player_games. i need your game data to test whether human or ai is better. now ai can play 1024 and more in about 60% and 2048 in about 10%.

I'm a sophomore in Shanghai University. This project is one of the tasks this semester. I'll have to submit my report before Feb 28th, 2025. so i need your game data as quickly as possible.

human_player:

| scores | max_tiles |
|--------|-----------|
| 28040 | 2048 |
| 28204 | 2048 |
